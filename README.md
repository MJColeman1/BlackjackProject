## Blackjack Project

### Week 3 Homework for Skill Distillery

#### Description 

The objective of this project is to create an application that runs the card game Blackjack. The application will allow the user to make decisions in an attempt to beat the computer player, based on the rules of Blackjack.

#### How To Run This Project

Before playing the game, the user will have the rules of Blackjack explained to them. The user will then be prompted to enter their name, and the game will begin. Both the player and the dealer will each be dealt two cards, but the player will only be able to see one of the dealer's cards. The player's current cards will be displayed, along with the value of those cards, and the user will have the option to either HIT or STAY by selecting (1) or (2). From there, the user has to simply follow on-screen prompts to continue playing the game until either the user or dealer busts. At that point, the user will be asked if they would like to play again or quit by selecting (1) or (2).

#### Technologies Used

* Classes with Objects as Fields
* While and Do-While Loops
* If and Else/If Statements
* Encapsulation
* Class Constructors
* Switch Statements
* Getters and Setters
* Try/Catch Statements for Exception Handling
* For-Each Loops
* Enums
* ArrayLists
* Collection types
* Recursion 


#### Lessons Learned

Implementing exception handling via Try/Catch statements was difficult for me. Implementing these statements without any errors during runtime is something I struggle with as I wasn't able to implement these statements in all necessary aspects of my code. It also caused bugs in my program with statements that were printing to the console that shouldn't have been printed out at that point in the program. The lesson learned here is that I need more practice with exception handling. 

Designing the class structure and figuring out how all the different classes communicate with each other is still very difficult for me. While building this program, the lesson I learned is that it helps to say things out loud in plain English i.e. "A dealer HAS A deck, a Game HAS A player and a dealer, a Deck HAS cards, a Card HAS A suit and rank, a Hand HAS cards", etc. This really helped me more clearly understand the concepts behind Object Oriented Programming and be able to code those concepts into a functional program, although I still need a lot more practice with it.
